# dotfiles
My set of simple dotfiles

## Getting started
In order to create some symlinks for the different configuration options and start using the pre-defined dotfiles, you just have to run the following command:

```
./init.sh
```

### Troubleshooting

If you already have some of the configuration files in your $HOME directory you may need to cleanup them manually, or if you feel confident enough (I mean you just started on a clean machine or you're 100% sure that you won't lose any custom configurations which you have) then run the following magic command:

```
./cleanup.sh
```
